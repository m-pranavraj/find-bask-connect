## 3. Email Authentication Configuration

Email/password authentication is automatically configured, but you need to adjust settings for optimal user experience.

### Steps:

1. **Open Lovable Cloud Backend**
   - Click the "View Backend" button above

2. **Configure Auth Settings**
   - Go to **Users** ‚Üí **Auth Settings** ‚Üí **Email Settings**

## 4. Create First Admin User

By default, all users have the "user" role. You need to manually create the first admin.

### Method 1: Using Lovable Cloud Backend (Recommended)

1. **Sign up normally** on your site at `/auth`
2. **Note your user ID**:
   - Click "View Backend" button
   - Go to **Users** ‚Üí **Users & Auth**
   - Find your user and copy the ID
3. **Open SQL Editor**:
   - In backend, go to **Database** ‚Üí **SQL Editor**
   - Run this query (replace `YOUR_USER_ID`):
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
     VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', 'admin');
     ```
4. **Verify**:
   - Log out and log back in
   - You should now see the "Admin Dashboard" in navigation

### Method 2: Using SQL (Alternative)

If you know your email, run this query:

```sql
-- Find your user ID
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';

-- Add admin role (use the ID from above)
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('user-id-from-above', 'admin');
```
